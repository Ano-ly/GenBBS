### **GenBBS Application Development Progress Report**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Project Goal:** To develop a robust Bill of Quantities/Materials (BBS) application with a modern graphical user interface.

---

#### **1. Initial Setup and UI Foundation**

The foundational elements for the GenBBS application's user interface have been successfully established:

*   **Splash Screen (`QSplashScreen`):** A splash screen, loaded from `assets/ui/GenBBS_loading.ui`, has been implemented to provide a smooth and branded startup experience. It displays a loading message while the application initializes.
*   **Screen Management (`QStackedWidget`):** The application utilizes a `QStackedWidget` within the `ApplicationWindow` to manage and switch between different views (screens). This provides a clean and efficient way to handle multi-screen navigation.
*   **UI File Integration (`QUiLoader`):** All `.ui` files, designed using Qt Designer, are dynamically loaded into their respective Python `QWidget` classes (e.g., `MainMenuScreen`, `NewProjectScreen`). This approach ensures a clear separation between UI design and application logic.
*   **Layout Management (`QVBoxLayout`):** To correctly display the loaded `.ui` content, each screen class now uses a `QVBoxLayout` to embed the loaded UI widget, ensuring proper rendering and preventing blank screens.
*   **Resource Compilation (`app_resources.qrc`):** The `app_resources.qrc` file has been compiled and updated to include all necessary image assets and `.ui` files, ensuring they are properly embedded within the application's resources.

#### **2. Screen Management and Navigation**

Significant progress has been made in structuring the application's screens and enabling basic navigation:

*   **Placeholder Screen Classes:** Dedicated `QWidget` classes have been created for each `.ui` file:
    *   `LoadingScreenWidget`
    *   `MainMenuScreen` (for `GenBBS.ui`)
    *   `NewProjectScreen` (for `GenBBS_newprj.ui`)
    *   `Category1Screen` (for `GenBBS_catg1.ui`)
    *   `Category2Screen` (for `GenBBS_catg2.ui`)
    *   `ElementManagementScreen` (for `GenBBS_element.ui`)
    *   `ReinforcementScreen` (for `GenBBS_reinf.ui`)
*   **`ApplicationWindow` as Navigator:** The `ApplicationWindow` class acts as the central orchestrator for screen transitions, holding instances of all screen widgets and managing the `QStackedWidget`.
*   **Main Menu Navigation:**
    *   The "crNewFile" button on the `MainMenuScreen` is connected to the `go_to_new_project_screen` method in `ApplicationWindow`, successfully transitioning to the `NewProjectScreen`.
    *   The "crExistingFile" button on the `MainMenuScreen` is connected to an `open_file_dialog` method, which utilizes `QFileDialog` to allow users to select existing project files.
*   **Back Navigation:** A "btnBackNewprj" button on the `NewProjectScreen` has been implemented and connected to the `go_to_main_menu_screen` method, allowing users to return to the main menu.
*   **Simplified Navigation:** Direct navigation methods for `Category1Screen`, `Category2Screen`, `ElementManagementScreen`, and `ReinforcementScreen` have been removed from `ApplicationWindow` as they are not directly accessible from the main menu, streamlining the navigation logic.

#### **3. Data Model Structure (Revised Proposal)**

A robust data model is essential for managing project information. The following object-oriented structure is proposed to represent the core entities of a GenBBS project:

*   **`Project` Class:**
    *   **Attributes:** `project_name`, `project_id` (unique ID), `creation_date`, `last_modified_date`, `categories` (list of `Category` objects), `file_path`.
    *   **Key Methods:** `__init__`, `add_category`, `remove_category`, `get_category`, `save_project`, `load_project` (class method), `to_dict`, `from_dict` (class method).
*   **`Category` Class:**
    *   **Attributes:** `category_name`, `category_id` (unique ID), `elements` (list of `Element` objects), `description`.
    *   **Key Methods:** `__init__`, `add_element`, `remove_element`, `get_element`, `to_dict`, `from_dict` (class method).
*   **`Element` Class:**
    *   **Attributes:** `element_name`, `element_id` (unique ID), `quantity`, `unit`, `unit_price`, `total_price` (calculated), `description`, `notes`, `bars` (list of `Bar` objects).
    *   **Key Methods:** `__init__`, `calculate_total_price`, `update_quantity`, `update_unit_price`, `add_bar`, `remove_bar`, `to_dict`, `from_dict` (class method).
*   **`Bar` Class:**
    *   **Attributes:** `bar_id` (unique ID), `diameter` (e.g., 8mm, 10mm), `length` (in meters), `shape` (e.g., 'straight', 'L-shape', 'U-shape'), `quantity` (number of bars), `weight_per_meter` (calculated based on diameter), `total_weight` (calculated).
    *   **Key Methods:** `__init__`, `calculate_weight_per_meter`, `calculate_total_weight`, `to_dict`, `from_dict` (class method).

**Backend Logic Considerations:**

*   **Serialization:** JSON will be used for saving and loading project data.
*   **Unique Identifiers:** The `uuid` module will generate unique IDs for all project components.
*   **Data Validation:** Future implementation will include robust data validation.
*   **`ProjectManager` (Conceptual):** A `ProjectManager` class will centralize project creation, loading, and saving.

#### **4. Backend-Frontend Integration Status**

The application is currently in a state where the frontend UI structure and navigation flow are largely established and functional. The backend data model has been conceptually designed, outlining the necessary classes and their interactions.

*   **Frontend:** The UI is capable of displaying different screens and handling basic user interactions for navigation.
*   **Backend:** The data model for `Project`, `Category`, `Element`, and `Bar` is defined conceptually, but the actual Python classes and their methods are yet to be implemented in code. The logic for creating a new project based on this data model and saving/loading project files is also pending implementation.

#### **Summary of Accomplishments:**

*   Implemented splash screen and `QStackedWidget` for UI management.
*   Integrated `.ui` files into Python classes with proper layouts.
*   Updated resource file to include all UI and image assets.
*   Established placeholder classes for all application screens.
*   Implemented main menu navigation to `NewProjectScreen`.
*   Integrated `QFileDialog` for opening existing project files.
*   Implemented back navigation from `NewProjectScreen` to `MainMenuScreen`.
*   Proposed a comprehensive data model structure for `Project`, `Category`, `Element`, and `Bar`.
